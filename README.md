--Q&A--


Q:Why does a console pop up when I run an encrypted app?

A:To prevent missuse of this software, ex:cryping viruses and other malware, I have added this console to show what is actually happening in the background.

Q:I found this "bug", where can I report it?

A:There's an issues tab on the project where you can report the afformentioned bug.

Q:Can you remove the console and stop it from popping up?

A:No.

Q:I get "lines exceeded" error in the compiler, what's going on?

A:You're trying to encrypt a very big application. Maximum size should be around 3k KB.
